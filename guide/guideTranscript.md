Hello, how can I help you today ma’am?

**I’d like some information on "Jacob: Recording on Wire," please?**

It was a sound experiment first conducted as early as 1898 by Valdemar Poulsen. He recorded, replayed, erased, and rerecorded the name, "Jacob" onto wire.

**Who is Valdemar Poulsen?**

He was a Danish Engineer, who experimented with impressing sound on wire. He later went on to develop the telegraphone, which was used to record Austrian emperor Franz Joseph at the 1900 Paris World Exhibition. **Let me connect you**

**That recording is quite long, why did Poulsen only say one word in the Jacob  experiment?**

Because he was confined to a small space, he only used as much wire as he could run across the room. In his later versions of the telegraphone, he used a spool of wire, which could hold much more information. 

**Why did he choose to record the word "Jacob"?**

Poulsen did have an uncle named Jacob but historical accounts don’t indicate that he was referring to his uncle specifically. Instead, it’s suggested that he chose the word for its distinct and strong syllables.

**Why do the syllables need to be strong?**

Playback was very faint, especially in this first iteration, so the word "Jacob" would have been easier to decipher. 

**How did Poulsen experiment with magnetic recording?**

In a secluded cabin in Denmark, Poulsen constructed a contraption that would magnetically record and replay the sound of his voice impressed on piano wire.

**How did this contraption work?**

**Let me transfer you to another operator with more information on this.**

Hello ma’am, I hear you want to know more about the function of Poulsen’s magnetic recording device. 

**Yes, I do.**

He strung piano wire from one side of a room to the other. Then he ran alongside the wire with a trolley containing an electromagnet. For the parts attached to the electromagnet, Poulsen deconstructed a wall-mounted telephone. 

**What were the functions of the telephone parts? **

The transmitter impressed the sound onto the wire and the receiver was used for playback.

**How did the telephone transmitter magnetize the wire? **

The telephone transmitter is connected to a battery and an electromagnet in a circuit. When a voice travels through the transmitter, it vibrates the diaphragm and causes carbon granules to compress and loosen. The electric flow fluctuates based on the speaker’s voice. This process magnetizes the wire.  

**How does the receiver playback the sound? **

The receiver is attached to an electromagnet and it contains a permanent magnet. When the electromagnet passes over a magnetized point on the wire, a disk inside the receiver is repeatedly pulled away from the permanent magnet. This fluctuation allows the listener to hear the recording.

**If it so difficult to hear playback, how do you know the sound has been impressed on the wire?**

Iron filings will cling to the magnetized parts of the wire. This works as a visual representations of stored information.

**Is magnetic recording obsolete?**

Magnetic recording is still used to store data today.

Can I help you with anything else?

**No, thank you. That’s all. **
