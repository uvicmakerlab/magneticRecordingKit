**Record: **

Connect the transmitter, battery, and electromagnet in a circuit.

 <image1>

Slide the trolley holding the electromagnet along the wire as you shout into the transmitter. Your voice will vibrate a disk, which will then compress and loosen carbon granules inside the transmitter. The electric current from the battery runs through the carbon granules, fluctuating according to your voice waves. When this fluctuating current reaches the electromagnet, it is imprinted magnetically along the wire.

**Test for Recording:**

Hold iron filings against the wire.

<image3>

As you pull the filings away from the wire, they will cling to the sections that have been magnetized by your voice.

<image4>

**Playback:**

Connect the receiver to the electromagnet.

<image5>

Inside the receiver is a permanent magnet holding a diaphragm down. As you slide the trolley and electromagnet back along the magnetized section, the magnetism of the wire repeatedly pulls the diaphragm away from the permanent magnet. This fluctuation allows you to hear the recording.

<image6>

**Erase:**

Place a permanent magnet on the wire.

<image 7>

As you slide the permanent magnet over the magnetized section it will remove all magnetism from the wire, effectively "deleting" the stored recording.
